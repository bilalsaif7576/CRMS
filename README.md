A new Flutter project.

Classroom Management System is a mobile application that aims to simplify the process 
of managing classrooms, schedules, and attendance for students, faculty, and 
administration. It provides a centralized platform for managing all the classroom-related 
data such as student and faculty information, class schedules, and room availability.
With the Classroom Management System, students can easily view their class schedules, 
access lecture notes, and stay informed about makeup lectures. Faculty members can 
manage their query about classrooms availability, while the administration can oversee 
the overall room management system and view free rooms. The application's primary 
focus is on room management, which helps students, faculty, and administration to find 
and book available rooms for various activities. This system ensures efficient use of 
resources and reduces the hassle of manual room scheduling. In summary, Classroom 
Management System is an efficient and user-friendly platform that streamlines 
classroom-related activities and enhances the overall learning experience for students and 
faculty alike
